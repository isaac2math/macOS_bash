## step 0: install macOS

## step 1: run docker_setup.sh

Before you start, save mac_setup.sh and mac_update.sh on your Documents folder 

then run it using the following command in terminal

<br>

    bash ~/Documents/mac_setup.sh

# step 2: routine update check

After you finish the previous step, you can automatically do the Homebrew/R/Julia/Python/... update using mac_check.sh

    bash ~/Documents/mac_update.sh
